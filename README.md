# Obsidian `nb` plugin

This is a [`nb`](https://github.com/xwmx/nb) wrapper for Obsidian.

## Installation

First clone the built plugin into your vault.

```sh
npx degit \
  epicmet/obsidian-nb-pluglin/dist \
  <PATH_TO_YOUR_VAULT>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-nb-pluglin # Modify if needed
```

Then reload community plugins from within Obsidian and enable the plugin.

### Why not Obsidian's community plugins section?

It's not registered as a standard community plugin within Obsidian because it's intended for developer use only.
